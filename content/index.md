title: Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is a collection of my notes and thoughts that I have created at different times. Some of these notes might not be work in progress as I intend to use this a growing corner for my knowledge and thoughts.  

These notes are written on Obsidian and I'm using Quartz to generate this my own space. I was using Obsidian to noting down things I learn for a while and I wanted a way to publish them. Initially it was just a git repo with my Obsidian notes and then I came up with a way to publish my notes to my main blog with the use of GitHub Actions and obsidian-to-hugo python library. While I was lazily reading through the Amethyst Hugo theme hoping adopting that for my notes I noticed Quartz. And at that moment I decided this is the way forward for my notes.
