title: Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is a collection of my notes and thoughts that I have created at different times. Some of these notes might not be work in progress as I intend to use this a growing corner for my knowledge and thoughts.  

These notes are written on Obsidian and I'm using Quartz to generate this my own space. I was using Obsidian to noting down things I learn for a while and I wanted a way to publish them. Iitially it was just a git repo with my Obsidian notes and then I came up with a way to publish my notes to my main blog with the use of Github Actions and obsidian-to-hugo python library. While I was lazyly reading through the Amathyst Hugo theme hoping adopting that for my notes I noticed Quartz. And at that moment I decied this is the way forward for my notes.

> Quartz has a strange mobile view. So if you are on mobile you wouldn't see the notes except for this home page. Type into the search box and you would see all the notes
